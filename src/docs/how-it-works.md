## How it works

### Creating a feed

Your feed is a collection of articles from different news sources. You create your feed so that it
contains articles in areas that interest you. We help create you your feed by combining articles
that are found on the web pages that you guide us to. We softly guide you through this process by
only allowing you to select websites that we can retrieve articles for.

### Example - The New York Times

The New York Times displays their articles on their website: [nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com). Their website is organised into sections, where each section contains the articles for different topics. For example [nytimes.com/section/business]() contains links to articles about, you guessed it, business. [nytimes.com/section/politics](#) instead contains links to articles surrounding (mainly) US politics.

Funnily enough, most news websites are structured like this. They have listing *sections* that contain many links to articles surrounding the topic of the *section* and then of course, they have the article pages themselves.

When creating or managing your feed, you need to specify the *sections* that contain the articles you're interested in. Let's say we're someone interested in politics, technology and business, but just from The New York Times. When we [manage our feed](/feed/manage), we create three New York Times sources and assign the following *sections* to them:
- section/politics
- section/technology
- section/business

We click 'Save' and the next time [our feed](/feed) updates, we will see articles from the New York Times from the *sections* we specified.


In reality, the great part doesn't come by limiting yourself to only articles from The New York Times. You can add different sources to your feed, like the BBC or Al Jazeera and identify different *sections* from their websites to create a feed of articles from your most-read news sources. We have lots of ideas to make your feed even *more* interesting and useful. Take a look at our [roadmap](/docs/roadmap) to see what other interesting features are in the pipeline.
