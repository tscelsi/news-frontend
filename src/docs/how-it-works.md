## Creating a feed

Your feed is a collection of articles from different news outlets. You curate your feed so that it only
contains articles in areas that interest you. We help create you your feed by combining articles
that are found on the web page at the endpoint you provide. So, if you provide a feed endpoint that
is the economy section of the New York Times, we provide you with a feed of articles from the
economy section of the New York Times.

Each news outlet is associated with their website. On these websites they have a whole lot of different types of news, in different areas and for different purposes. We want to curate your feed with only articles that interest you. So your job is to find the areas of a website that interest you, and provide us with the URL of that area. Once we have the url, we add the articles from that area to your feed. So that you an easily navigate to the articles that interest you, but you don't have to trawl through all the different sections/different websites in order to find what is interesting.
