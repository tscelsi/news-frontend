## Mission

The [pileof.news](/src/pages/index.tsx) mission is simple:

1. Make it easy to maintain a well-rounded, informed perspective on the news.
2. Reduce the amount of lost time spent finding interesting news media.
3. Begin to collect and distribute openly (where possible) a dataset of news media content for research purposes.

## Values

### 1. journalistic integrity

It's important to preserve the integrity and respect the effort of the journalists who create the articles that are displayed on this website. That's why authors are credited, the entire article contents isn't displayed, and an easy way to read more is provided by linking back to the original source.

### 2. tech for good

I believe that technology should be used harmoniously with humanity as a way to enhance the human experience instead of replacing it. The lives we lead online are plagued with distraction, misinformation and social media recommendation systems that are tailored to show us more of what we want to hear or the things that make us, as people, most divided.

[pileof.news](/src/pages/index.tsx) is meant to be a way to help people stay informed and receive points of view on the same topics from a variety of sources. Hopefully it also helps to minimise the constant barrage of notifications and distracting, divisive content from other media sites. The hope is that this site helps to make media and daily news more accessible and pleasant to consume and also helps save time to do other things.

### 3. data transparency

I want to be transparent about how data is collected and used on this site. As such, most/all of the code used to create both the engine behind the site and the site itself are open source.
