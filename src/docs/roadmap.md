## Roadmap

[pileof.news](#) was created as a hobby project, with the idea to combine facets of natural language processing, machine learning, web development and UI/UX design into one useful and interesting arrangement. If you would like to contribute to the project, it is publically available on [github](). If reading some of the following excites you, or you have other great ideas, or if you just want to chat more about it, you can reach out to me by any of the contact methods [here](#).

The project is still in its infancy, but the following are some ambitious features that are planned for the future:

- **User feedback! (web-dev, UI/UX)**
  
  We want to hear from you. What news sources are missing? What are some of the features that are most interesting to you? An easy-to-use feedback system is essential to the website so that we can continue to improve it.

- **More news sources!**
  
  There's always room for more news sources to give users a more varied and interesting set of websites to see articles from. In the future we may also look into providing articles from blogs like Medium, or even from social media platforms like Twitter.

- **Multiple feeds per-account (web-dev, UI/UX)**
  
  Thematically segment your news feeds into different categories making it as easy as possible to see news about different topics, all in one place.

- **Example feeds (web-dev, UI/UX)**
  
  Finding it difficult to create your own feed? We'll provide you with some example feeds that you can use as a starting point.

- **News story comparison (NLP, web-dev, UI/UX)**
  
  Compare the framing and tone of the same story, written by different news outlets. When you're looking at articles side by side, you can see how different news outlets frame the same story, and how they choose to highlight different aspects of the story. This can help you to better understand the story, and to see how different news outlets are trying to influence your opinion.

- **Article and source recommendation system (NLP, ML|DL, web-dev, UI/UX)**

  (opt-in feature) When creating or browsing your feed wouldn't it be nice to have related sources of media suggested to you that align with the theme of your feed? These could be in the form of similar sources to ones that you already follow, or sources that 'balance' your feed with another point of view, creating a more holistic and well rounded news experience.
